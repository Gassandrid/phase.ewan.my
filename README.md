A very basic visualization tool I made to help me understand the concepts I am learning in Chaos Thoery, in the context of theoretical neuroscience.

This allows you to play around with the phase space of a morris lecar neuron simulation, and visualize chaos theory concepts like unstable/stable manifolds, fixed-points and limit cycles, along with andrenov hopf bifurcations.
